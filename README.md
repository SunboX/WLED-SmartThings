## Please note that I have decided to replace SmartThings in favor of a Zigbee/Zwave USB stick connected directly my Home Assistant server. This device handler's code is available for anyone to review/modify, but I will no longer participate in its development. Thank you ##

# WLED-SmartThings
SmartThings Device handler for WLED

 - Copy all content of the device handler file into you ST IDE.
 - Add device through IDE
 - Setup IP and port in ST app (type port even though already there!!!)
 - Done

Please note that this was custom made for my needs, and that on/off, color and brightness are working. None of the effects etc were implemented. Also confirmed to work with Google Home when linked to ST.
